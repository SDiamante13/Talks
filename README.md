## About

Steven Diamante is a technical coach who helps software teams get real value from AI coding agents. Most teams use AI to generate code fast, but then spend hours debugging. Steven teaches teams to use TDD and strict quality gates to keep AI agents steerable, ensuring they build the right thing in small, controllable steps. Through hands-on Samman Coaching, he helps teams transform how they work with AI while maintaining technical excellence.

Outside of coaching, he enjoys playing guitar in his local church, reading a non-fiction book, or hanging out with his wife and two kids.
