# Let's Make Long Methods a Thing of the Past

## Abstract

Developers write code as a form of communication. The code they write should tell a story and be self-explanatory. Unfortunately, there is a lot of codebases containing long, complex and hard to read methods. Developers spend a significant amount of their time reading code. The easier it is to read, then the more time they can focus on delivering business value to customers.

In this talk, attendees will learn how to recognize long methods and code paragraphs. Additionally, they will learn about simple refactoring techniques to make the code easier to understand.

Attendees will come away from this session with the ability to

- identify long methods
- refactor long methods to cleaner code
- improve naming
