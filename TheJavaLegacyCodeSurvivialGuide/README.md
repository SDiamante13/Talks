# The Java Legacy Code Survival Guide: Add Features Without Fear

## Abstract

How do you feel when you need to add a new feature to a legacy system with no tests, confusing naming, and tight coupling? Nervous? Anxious? What if there was a way to make it safer to work with and even enjoyable?

The key is to make the code safer to work with by adding tests, improving names, and refactoring toward OO principles like encapsulation and abstraction. Through live coding examples, you’ll see how small, simple refactorings can make adding new features easier.

By the end of this session, you’ll be able to

- identify common Java code smells
- apply refactoring techniques to improve code design
- safely add new features to your codebases with confidence
