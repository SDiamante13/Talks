# Refactor Java with Confidence Workshop

## Abstract

Refactoring isn’t just cleanup. It’s how great developers keep code fast and flexible.

If you’ve ever struggled with messy logic, confusing names, or code that’s hard to change, this hands-on workshop will level up your refactoring skills.

What we’ll cover:

- Refactoring fundamentals: what refactoring is, when to do it, and why it matters
- Testing for safe refactoring: using Approval Testing and Mutation Testing to prevent regressions
- Small wins, big impact: techniques like renaming, simplifying logic, and improving structure
- Decoupling code for maintainability: separating business logic from I/O for cleaner, more adaptable systems

Expect plenty of coding, guided exercises, and practical takeaways you can apply immediately. Whether you’re new to refactoring or looking to sharpen your expertise, this workshop will give you the confidence to refactor fearlessly.
